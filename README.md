# Docker Container for WRF (Updated Version)

This containerized environment for the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) modeling system was modernized and extended by **Boyuan (Keven) Guan** as part of the **FIU EnviStor project**.

The original Docker configuration was provided by *John Exby* and *Kate Fossell*. From their work, this updated version introduces several fixes and enhancements to support updated dependencies and robust use in modern Linux-based systems.

---

## üîß Enhancements in This Version

- Fixed failing downloads due to deprecated or moved URLs.
- Replaced `tar -xz` with `tar -x` for misidentified gzip formats.
- Verified all tutorial and regression test data availability with `curl --head` before attempting download.
- Ensured `netcdf-fortran` compiles properly by aligning environment variables and linking order.
- Replaced legacy `ENV key value` syntax with modern `ENV key=value` in Dockerfile.
- Recovered broken dependency links from official mirrors and GitHub.
- Verified tutorial builds end-to-end and support interactive sessions in container.
- Added attribution and version control support under Keven's GitHub fork.

---

## üì¶ Included in the Container

- Source code for **WRF** and **WPS** from GitHub
- External libraries required for WRF and WPS
- CentOS 7-based OS image with traditional user-level Linux capabilities
- GNU Compiler support via `devtoolset-8`
- OpenMPI for distributed memory execution
- NCL for post-processing WRF output (PDF support)
- Static low-resolution data for `geogrid`
- Two Dockerfiles:
  - `Dockerfile_tutorial`
  - `Dockerfile_regtest`
- Sample data and scripts for:
  - Running the WRF Tutorial case
  - Executing regression tests via script

---

## üîÄ Choose a Dockerfile

Depending on the use case, link the appropriate Dockerfile:
```bash
ln -sf Dockerfile_tutorial Dockerfile
# or
ln -sf Dockerfile_regtest Dockerfile
```

---

## üöÄ Tutorial Case

The [README_tutorial.md](README_tutorial.md) provides full step-by-step instructions to run the WRF model:

```bash
docker build -t wrf_tutorial .
mkdir OUTPUT
docker run -it --name teachme -v `pwd`/OUTPUT:/wrf/wrfoutput wrf_tutorial /bin/tcsh
```

---

## üß™ Regression Test Case (Updated for Docker)

This case is designed to validate code correctness and performance across model configurations using the official WRF regression testing suite inside a Docker container.

### üöÄ Build and Launch the Container

```bash
docker build -t wrf_regtest .
docker run -d -t --name test_001 wrf_regtest /bin/tcsh
```

### ‚öôÔ∏è Required Patches to `regtest.csh`

The original `regtest.csh` was designed for NCAR‚Äôs HPC environment and requires the following patches to work inside Docker:

1. **Set required environment variables manually at the top of `regtest.csh`:**

```tcsh
set WRFREGDATAEM = /wrf
set WRFREGDATANMM = /wrf
set DEF_DIR = /wrf
set acquire_from = /wrf
set OPENMP = FALSE
set Num_Procs = 4
set ARCH = Linux
set MPIRUNCOMMAND = "mpirun -np 4"
set COMPOPTS = ( default default default default default )
set COMPOPTS_NO_NEST = ( default default default default default )
set BUILD_SCRIPT = ''
set RUN_SCRIPT = ''
set DIFF_SCRIPT = ''
set POST_SCRIPT = ''
set ZAP_SERIAL_FOR_THIS_CORE = FALSE
set ZAP_OPENMP_FOR_THIS_CORE = FALSE
```

2. **Bypass the interactive `./configure` menu:**

Find this block in the script:
```tcsh
./configure $DEBUG_FLAG << EOF
$compopt
$compopts_nest
EOF
```

Replace it with:
```tcsh
echo 34 | ./configure $DEBUG_FLAG
```

This selects option 34 (GNU + dmpar) non-interactively.

3. **You do NOT need `run_regtest.tcsh`.**  
All environment setup is now embedded directly in `regtest.csh`.

### üõ†Ô∏è Copy Updated Script Into Container

```bash
docker cp regtest.csh test_001:/wrf/WRF/tools/regtest.csh
docker exec --user root test_001 chmod +x /wrf/WRF/tools/regtest.csh
docker exec --user root test_001 chown wrfuser:wrf /wrf/WRF/tools/regtest.csh
```

### ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Run the Regression Test

```bash
docker exec test_001 tcsh /wrf/WRF/tools/regtest.csh BUILD CLEAN 34 1 em_real -d
docker exec test_001 tcsh /wrf/WRF/tools/regtest.csh RUN em_real 34 em_real 03
```

### üßº Optional Cleanup

```bash
docker stop test_001
docker rm test_001
```


Additional test configurations are described in [README_regtest.md](README_regtest.md).
